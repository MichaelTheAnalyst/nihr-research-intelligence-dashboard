**ROI Ratio: 15:1 to 22:1** (For every £1 invested, CTU saves £15-£22)

**Payback Period: Less than 3 weeks**

---

## 💰 **MONETARY ROI BREAKDOWN**

### **1. Time Savings from Automated Data Analysis**

**Manual Analysis Time Without Dashboard:**
- Data quality assessment: 16-20 hours per month
- Missing value detection: 8-10 hours per month
- Duplicate analysis: 6-8 hours per month
- Performance benchmarking: 12-16 hours per month
- Report generation: 8-12 hours per month
- **Total: 50-66 hours per month**

**With Dashboard: Instant (5 minutes to load data)**

**Staff Typically Performing This Work:**
- Business Intelligence Analyst (Level 5): £46,049 - £58,225/year
- Or Project Manager (Level 4): £36,636 - £44,746/year

**Calculation (Using Level 4 Project Manager mid-range: £40,691/year):**
- Hourly rate: £40,691 ÷ 1,820 working hours = £22.36/hour
- Monthly time saved: 50-66 hours
- **Monthly savings: 50h × £22.36 = £1,118 to 66h × £22.36 = £1,476**
- **Annual savings: £13,416 to £17,712**

### **2. Improved Decision-Making Speed**

**Scenario: Strategic funding decisions**

**Before Dashboard:**
- Committee requests analysis: 2-3 weeks turnaround
- Multiple revision cycles: +1-2 weeks
- Data validation delays: +3-5 days
- **Total: 4-6 weeks per major decision**

**With Dashboard:**
- Real-time insights: Same-day response
- Interactive exploration: Instant answers
- Data validation: Built-in and automated
- **Total: Hours, not weeks**

**Impact on Opportunity Costs:**
- Faster response to funding opportunities
- Quicker identification of underperforming programmes
- Earlier detection of portfolio risks

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 6 major funding decisions per year
- Each delayed by 4 weeks = 24 weeks saved annually
- Senior decision-maker time (Level 6): £59,966 - £74,851/year
- Using mid-range £67,408: £37/hour
- **24 weeks × 10 hours stakeholder time × £37 = £8,880/year**

**Rework Costs:**
- Re-analysis: 20-30 hours per error
- Stakeholder re-briefings: 10-15 hours
- Average 2-3 significant errors per year caught and corrected

**Calculation:**
- 2.5 errors × 25 hours rework × £22.36/hour = £1,395/year
- Plus stakeholder time: 2.5 × 12.5 hours × £37/hour = £1,156/year
- **Total error reduction savings: £2,551/year**

- Data quality improvement: 1% waste reduction
- **Annual savings: £1,716,000 × 1% = £17,160/year**
- **Conservative 3-year attribution to dashboard: £5,720/year**
