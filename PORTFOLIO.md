## 🎯 **Interview Talking Points**

### **"Tell me about a project you're proud of"**
*"I built a healthcare research funding analytics dashboard that transforms 50+ hours of monthly manual analysis into 5 minutes of automated insights. The project demonstrates technical proficiency in Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, strategic thinking through ROI analysis showing £348K+ value over 3 years, and stakeholder-focused design serving MPs, administrators, and executives. It's production-ready quality with comprehensive documentation and measurable business impact."*

### **"What was your biggest challenge?"**
*"Designing for multiple stakeholder groups with different needs - MPs need quick constituency facts, administrators need detailed quality metrics, executives need strategic KPIs. I solved this through progressive disclosure: high-level executive summary for quick insights, tabbed navigation for detailed analysis, and interactive visualizations for exploratory analysis. The result is a dashboard that serves all stakeholders while maintaining professional simplicity."*

### **"How do you demonstrate business value?"**
*"I created a comprehensive ROI analysis quantifying seven categories of savings: time savings from automation (£13K-£18K), faster decisions (£9K-£15K), error reduction (£2.5K-£5K), consultancy avoidance (£8K-£12K), portfolio optimization (£69K-£100K), reporting efficiency (£8K-£12K), and data quality improvements (£6K-£10K). The total annual value is £116K-£172K with a 5-day payback period and 122:1 three-year ROI. I also documented eight non-monetary benefits including strategic decision-making capability and competitive intelligence."*
